JSUnify: Simple and Efficient JavaScript / CoffeeScript unification library

Uses an algorythm (described in doc/pseudocode-website) with worst-case linear time complexity.

This library is still in very early stages and not yet ready for mainstream use.

Overview: for more, see doc/pseudocode-website
1) "Tin" - tree instance
    These objects have two pointers, node (which points to an element in the input tree) 
    and varlist (which points to a list of other tins, one per Var in the input tree)
2) "Var" - unification variable
    Create these objects to signal to the library that slot is a variable
3) "_" - match anything variable (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
    Create a Var("_") to signal that slot could contain anything

Usage / Hacking:
1) Build the coffeescript into JS
    cd src
    coffee -c JSUnify.coffee
2) Include the JS in your HTML file
    <script language="JavaScript" src="JSUnify.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
3) Call functions
    tinlist = JSUnify.parse([{a: [1,2,3]}, {a: [1,new JSUnify.Var("b"),3]}])
    success = JSUnify.unify(tinlist)
    b = JSUnify.get_value(tinlist,"b")
