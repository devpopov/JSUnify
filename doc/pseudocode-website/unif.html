Unification is a basic operation in many symbolic artificial intelligence
systems.  Unification is, given two first-order terms, find a substitution
of the variables in the terms so that they become identical.  Reference (1)
gives a good introduction to unification and gives textbook algorithm for
finding the most general unifier.  The problem is that this algorithm has
exponential worse case complexity.  Other algorithms are known that have
linear worse case complexity (2) but these are very complicated to
implement.

<P>
I am implementing a resolution theorem proving program for a class project
and I wrote a unification algorithm which has linear complexity, I think.
It is easy to implement, and it has a number of extra benefits.
I will use the following example.  Assume w,x,y,z are variables and we
want to unify f(x,t(x),z) and f(a,y,h(w,y)).  First convert the
terms to tree structure as follows

<p>
<img src=unif0.png>
<p>

<!--
<PRE>

  tree1   tree2
   f       f
   |       |
   1-t-2   a-1-h
     |         |
     1         2-1
</PRE>
-->

In the trees each variable is replaced by a number unique in the term.
These trees are READ ONLY, they are not changed by the unification
process and they can be refered to by many term instances in the database.
This structure sharing saves a lot of storage in the theorem
proving program.

<P>
The unification program works on term instances (tins).  A tin has
a pointer to a tree, and a pointer to a variable list.  The
size of the variable list depends on the number of variables in the
tree.  (in the example both trees have two variables).  The variable
list is actually an array of tins.  The tins in the var list
have two pointers also, if both of these are null, we say the tin
is free, or unbound.

<P>
The two tins for the example would be:

 tin1:   (++)--(**)(**)     tin2:  (++)--(**)(**)
</PRE>

that is they both have a head tin that points to the structure tree
and to a list of free tins size 2.
<P>
The unification procedure is recursive, it walks the structure trees
pointed to by the two terms.  It returns 1=unify was successful or
0=unify failed.

<P>
<PRE>
procedure unify(n1,v1,n2,v2)
  n1 and n2 are nodes in the structure trees.
  v1 and v2 are variable lists corresponding to current instances
     of the trees.
begin
  if n1 and n2 are both null return 1
  if either is null return 0
  if n1 and n2 are variables then
    let t1 = lookup the binding of n1 in v1       (*1*)
    let t2 = lookup the binding of n2 in v2
    if t1 and t2 both are free then
      bind the one with the shorter chain to the one with the longer chain
    else
    if only one is free then
      bind the free one to the bound one
    else
    if both are bound then try to unify them,
      call unify(t1.node,t1.varlist,t2.node,t2.varlist)
  endif
  else
  if only n1 is a variable then
    let t1 = lookup the binding of n1 in v1
    if the t1 is free then bind it,
      set t1.node = n2 and t1.varlist = v2
    else
      try to unify(t1.node, t1.varlist, n2,v2)
  endif
  else
  if only n2 is a variable then
    do analogous to when only n1 is a var
  endif
  else must be that neither is a variable
    if n1 doesn't match n2 return 0
    try to unify all the children of n1 with the children of n2,
    unify(n1 child 1, v1, n2 child 1, v2)
    unify(n1 child 2, v1, n2 child 2, v2)
    unify(n1 child 3, v1, n2 child 3, v2)
    unify(n1 child 4, v1, n2 child 4, v2)
    ...
  end
endproc

<P>
After running this procedure on the example, the tins look like this

In this figure: Tin1 points to the f in the first tree and tin1 has two variables
x and z in its varlist.  x has two pointers, a pointer to a structure and
to a varlist, they point to the 'a' in tree2 and the varlist of tin2,
respectively.  z points to the 'h' and to the same varlist in tin2.
Tin2 has two variables also, y and w.  y is bound to 't' and points to
varlist of tin1.  w is free.

<P>
The unification succeeded.  If we were to print the value of the variable
z we would print z = h(w,t(a)).  To print the value of z we print the tree it
points to using the varlist it points to lookup any variables that may
occur in the tree and recursively print them.

<P>
This algorithm has worst case linear complexity.  Each recursive
invocation of the unify function either dereferences a variable or
moves to a new node in the structure tree.  If n is the number of nodes
in the structure trees and m is the number of variables, unify will be
called recursively at most n+m times.

<P>
There is one case that was not spelled out yet.  When two vars are free,
as in (*1*), then one is shared to the other.  This is done using a special
kind of "chain" tin in which the structure pointer is null and the varlist
pointer points to the tin of the other variable.  When
a term has many variables these chains can grow long.  For example when
f(w,w,x,x,y,y,z) is unified with f(s,t,t,u,u,v,v), (assume s..z are vars)
then first w chains to s, then t chains to w, then x chains to t, etc.
When both vars are free, it doesn't matter which is chained to which.
By carefully choosing which to chain, we can ensure that the length of
the longest chain does not grow faster that O(log(n)) where n is the
number of variables processed by unify.  These are the rules for
chaining two free vars.
<OL>
<LI>if one of the vars has a chain longer than the other, link the
shorter one to the longer.
<LI>else always link the t1 var to t2 var, this ensures that the chain
does not zig-zag between the terms.
</OL>
In my theorem prover program each time a variable is bound or shared,
a pointer to it is added to a "changelist".  When unify is finished,
I can quickly undo the effect of the unify by going though the changelist
and setting all the tins it points to to "free" (two null pointers).
<P>
The benefits of using this algorithm are
<OL>
<li>it is time efficient:  linear worst case complexity
<li>it is space efficient:  structures are shared by many term instances,
no new memory needs to be allocated during unification, extra
overhead is just two pointers per variable.
<li>it is easy to add an un-unify feature to it by keeping a list of
changes during unify.
